001day-July 2nd 2017Happy Canada day! Reset challenge and retook the challenge.   FUCK THE SHAME!!  Shame is to be in the void, doing nothing.  I can not guarantee I won't stall again in the future but I can totally guarantee that I will reset and continue over and over.  Today I reviewed my "tribute" page most likely my mock page and I know it is not going to be perfect the first time and accept it.
