001day-July 2nd 2017 Happy Canada day! Reset and retook the challenge.   FUCK THE SHAME!!  Shame is to be in the void, doing nothing.  I can not guarantee I won't stall again in the future but I can totally guarantee that I will reset and continue over and over and over.  Today I reviewed my "tribute" page most likely my mock page and I know it is not going to be perfect the first time and have accepted it.
/*002-005 july 6 2017.  Working in T-page.  Formatting page and learning on the fly more about CSS "style" properties, inline and global
D006-July 07.  Added style= margin, padding, text-align, Table, found out about <figure> and <figcaption>.  Page satisfy all the criteria of the assigment and now I can move forward on FCC.  I can come back and fix it, or do a better page, and reverse-engineering the sample page to see all the neat tricks and see how far I was from the "ideal" <p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="EWzPpr" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Arirang777" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="EWzPpr" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/Arirang777/pen/EWzPpr/">EWzPpr</a> by Izzy Kiskiriskis (<a href="https://codepen.io/Arirang777">@Arirang777</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

D007-Jul 08.  Analized sample tribute page and compared it to mine.  Little triks found. Good.   Seeing portfolios to get some inspiration
D008.Jul 9:  Still studying sample tribute page, copied all HTML and CSS and doesnn't display the same, why? because I have to set to load bootstrat3 on the pen page, that's why
